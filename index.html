        <h2>The Open Exoplanet Catalogue</h2>
        <p>With the recent discovery of the Trappist-1 planetary system and its Earth-sized planets, Exoplanet research has garnered much attention. The following tools allow you to explore the <b>Open Exoplanet Catalogue</b> to find your own Earth-like planet! This collection currently contains over 3000 planets. The data is presented as is but has been initially filtered to a subset which have Surface Temperatures around that of Earth's.</p>
        <h2>Exploring the data</h2>
        <p class="list">Use the Parallel Coordinates (PC) chart to refine your selection of planets - draw on each line to select a range; then explore your selection further in the Bar chart by selecting different attributes for the y-axis and get accurate values from the individual tooltips. With these tools see if you can answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>What basic conditions does Earth have?</li>
            <li>What are the similarities and differences between Earth and other planets?</li>
        </ul>
